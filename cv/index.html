      I helped found <a href="https://aerion.com.au" class="p-affiliation h-card p-name">Aerion Technologies</a>
      while I was still in University.
    </p>
      Throughout my 15 years there, I gained a significant amount of experience 
      across many different aspects of software development. Beyond programming 
      in many different languages, I have also had experience with UX / UI design,
      requirements gathering, documentation, project management and so much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have personally overseen all aspects of a project, from initial client meetings
      and discovery, through design and clarification, front-end and back-end development,
      all the way through to DevOps, deployment and user acceptance testing. I've worked
      with and alongside businesses from many different disciplines including 
      international architecture and construction companies as well as entrepeneurs
      needing technical assistance to see their idea through and small businesses who
      just need an online presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a tinkerer by nature. I have many personal side project ideas and things
      I am interested in. I've done quite a bit of work in the early days of
      <a href="https://obsidian.md/" class="p-affiliation h-card p-name">Obsidian</a>,
      building in CSS tweaks and new functionality before themes and plugins were
      officially supported; helping shape the direction of some of those features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordon-pedersen/" class="u-url">LinkedIn</a>
      for endorsements and such. (I'm not very good at LinkedIn, tbh)
    </p>
    <p>
      Below I have listed some of the projects I have been involved with, both with
      Aerion and in my own free time. This list isn't exhaustive, but does represent
      a cross-section of my varied experience and skills. (I'm still working on 
      populating this)

    <summary>A unique way to view open panes in Obsidian</summary><p>In early 2020, I found myself inspired to try and collect my thoughts in a
collection of linked notes. I was mostly inspired by <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak</a>
and the way his notes website opened linked notes in columns, so you could see
where you'd been.</p>
<p>I did attempt to create my own similar thing for a bit, but then I discovered
<a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. It was pretty new at the time, but seemed to do
what I wanted in terms of linking notes together.</p>
<p>However, it didn't have the cool horizontal stacked notes thing that Andy Matuschak's
website had. However, based on my experiments with building a similar thing myself,
I thought I could modify the internal CSS of Obsidian to present notes in a similar
format. And it worked! Not only that, it was <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/170">pretty popular</a> with others!</p>
<p>Later in the year, the Obsidian team opened up their plugin API (which I helped
discuss with the devs) and I migrated my fun CSS tweak into a full-blown JavaScript
plugin. Doing so won me the inaugural <a href="https://obsidian.md/blog/2020-goty-winners/">Best Plugin</a>
of the year in 2020.</p>
<p>The functionality has been since incorporated into the core of Obsidian. By using
the &quot;stack tabs&quot; option, you get vertically stacked notes that slide over each other,
just like I'd envisioned from Andy Matuschak's website.</p>

    <summary>An interactive educational game which simulates a Robotic Mission to Mars, including control of a real-life robot!</summary><p>This was one of my favourite projects to work on, despite the frustrations.
A cloud-based application for the Victorian Space Science Education Center (VSSEC),
which would allow a class of secondary school children log in, be assigned various
mission roles and run a simulated Mars Rover mission.</p>
<p>The kicker: students actually ended up controlling a physical rover robot that would
drive around VSSEC's on-site Mars simulation area.</p>
<p>It was a technical challenge to run 12+ users concurrently viewing the same set of
data, and issuing requests and instructions to each other. Data was partially plotted
in advance, and partially randomised. There were also random events like dust storms
or electromagnetic interference, which the students would have to cooperate and
coordinate to overcome.</p>
<p>Plus the added technical challenge of interfacing with VSSEC's rover, as well as
computer vision data to track its physical location on the ground. It would've been
so much easier to simulate that data along with the rest, but you can't beat the
coolness factor of driving a real robot and seeing the live feed from its camera.</p>
<p>Also, once development was almost complete, we recieved graphic designs from a
design agency, which required a lot of re-working to the front-end to make it fit
the final design. It ended up looking great, though.</p>

    <summary>A platform for digital marketing in the retail sector</summary><p>This was a big project.</p>
<p>It started small enough. A system to print shelf tickets for a group of pharmacies.
Of course, that had its own technical challenges. Not least of which was printing
from a browser in such a way that it would be consistent with pre-printed and/or
pre-perforated paper. We ended up developing an unobtrusive background application
for windows that would handle communication with the printer, and a separate web
system for creating the print jobs.</p>
<p>This expanded a lot. We built an entire visual editor for printible tickets with
multiple dynamic labels and layouts of those labels. We also expanded the management
side of the system to handle promotional periods and other forms of marketing.
The idea became for marketing departments to create and upload assets and product
pricing details, and the stores just had to log on and print what was relevant to
them.</p>
<p>With nearly a thousand stores using the system, there was a lot of iteration around
the UI/UX of the system, especially about making life easier for the store users.
We also started handling support tickets and calls (myself included) in order to
better assist the stores. This helped me put an emphesis on the UX design, as I
got to know the kinds of people that were using the system (and designing things
so I had less support tickets to attend do :P ).</p>
<p>Before I left, I was part of the management of the product as a whole, and was
working on a big redesign and re-branding. Partially in an attempt to simplify
the entire system, and to reach out to more non-pharmacy retail chains and outlets.</p>
