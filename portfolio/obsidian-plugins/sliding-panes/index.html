  <h2 class="obsidian-plugin">Sliding Panes (Andy Matuschak Mode)</h2>
<p>Skills: <span class="p-skill">CSS</span>, <span class="p-skill">JavaScript</span>, <span class="p-skill">HTML</span></p>
<p>In early 2020, I found myself inspired to try and collect my thoughts in a
collection of linked notes. I was mostly inspired by <a href="https://notes.andymatuschak.org/">Andy Matuschak</a>
and the way his notes website opened linked notes in columns, so you could see
where you'd been.</p>
<p>I did attempt to create my own similar thing for a bit, but then I discovered
<a href="https://obsidian.md">Obsidian</a>. It was pretty new at the time, but seemed to do
what I wanted in terms of linking notes together.</p>
<p>However, it didn't have the cool horizontal stacked notes thing that Andy Matuschak's
website had. However, based on my experiments with building a similar thing myself,
I thought I could modify the internal CSS of Obsidian to present notes in a similar
format. And it worked! Not only that, it was <a href="https://forum.obsidian.md/t/170">pretty popular</a> with others!</p>
<p>Later in the year, the Obsidian team opened up their plugin API (which I helped
discuss with the devs) and I migrated my fun CSS tweak into a full-blown JavaScript
plugin. Doing so won me the inaugural <a href="https://obsidian.md/blog/2020-goty-winners/">Best Plugin</a>
of the year in 2020.</p>
<p>The functionality has been since incorporated into the core of Obsidian. By using
the &quot;stack tabs&quot; option, you get vertically stacked notes that slide over each other,
just like I'd envisioned from Andy Matuschak's website.</p>
