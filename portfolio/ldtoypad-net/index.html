  <p>This was a little bit more of a hack to see if I could, rathen than it being
something truly useful, but it is still pretty cool. I found other attempts to
do the same thing in other languages, but couldn't get anthing actually working.</p>
<p>Through a lot of reading, and some trial and error, I worked out how to communicate
with the toypad, and then wrote up a library that allows me to connect to it,
change the lights, and most importantly, read the physical tags placed on it.</p>
<p>The reason for doing this is to automate some things on my computer. As a proof
of concept, I made myself a little app that sits in the system tray. When I
place my Batman minifigure on the right panel of the toypad, my computer switches
to another remote desktop. Place him on the left, and I go back to the original
desktop. I also set up a custom Joker minifigure tag which, when placed in the
middle sport, will hibername my computer.</p>
<p>It's fun, but I've never gotten used to multiple desktops, so I rarely used it.
I ought to come up with some better ideas and hook it back up one of these days...</p>
