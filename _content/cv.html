        It's hard to know what to include in a list of skills, so I've resorted

      I helped found <a href="https://aerion.com.au" class="p-affiliation h-card p-name">Aerion Technologies</a>
      while I was still in University.
    </p>
      Throughout my 15 years there, I gained a significant amount of experience 
      across many different aspects of software development. Beyond programming 
      in many different languages, I have also had experience with UX / UI design,
      requirements gathering, documentation, project management and so much more.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have personally overseen all aspects of a project, from initial client meetings
      and discovery, through design and clarification, front-end and back-end development,
      all the way through to DevOps, deployment and user acceptance testing. I've worked
      with and alongside businesses from many different disciplines including 
      international architecture and construction companies as well as entrepeneurs
      needing technical assistance to see their idea through and small businesses who
      just need an online presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm a tinkerer by nature. I have many personal side project ideas and things
      I am interested in. I've done quite a bit of work in the early days of
      <a href="https://obsidian.md/" class="p-affiliation h-card p-name">Obsidian</a>,
      building in CSS tweaks and new functionality before themes and plugins were
      officially supported; helping shape the direction of some of those features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/gordon-pedersen/" class="u-url">LinkedIn</a>
      for endorsements and such. (I'm not very good at LinkedIn, tbh)
    </p>
    <p>
      Below I have listed some of the projects I have been involved with, both with
      Aerion and in my own free time. This list isn't exhaustive, but does represent
      a cross-section of my varied experience and skills. (I'm still working on 
      populating this)
