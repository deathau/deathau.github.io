I've always wanted to get into game development. It's not easy, though. For this
project I decided to try and learn something completely new. I didn't have much
experience with Ruby as a programming language, but here was the [DragonRuby Game
Toolkit](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game) and a tutorial on how to make a 
simple Tetris-like game.

However, I couldn't just follow a tutorial then slap a price tag on it, so I took
things further. I combed through various asset and sound libraries I'd purchased
over the years through Humble Bundles and brainstormed ideas. I eventually came 
up with "Cube Tube", a variation of Tetris where you load cargo on a train.

I adjusted and tweaked and flipped everything on its side. I opened up MagicaVoxel
and created a subway station and a voxel train, using those to generate my 2D art.
I also found some music I kinda liked in my packs and tweaked and chopped it up
to make a new soundtrack. I spent way too much time trying to make the music more
dynamic; I initially wanted it to get faster and faster and the speed of the game
increased. Unfortunately, it just ended up beyond my capabilities. People still
like the music though, so that's cool.

I look at the code base now, and I wonder how much of it was actually in that 
original tutorial. Probably not much, anymore. I also tweaked the game for touch
controls, and built and tested a mobile version, for both Android and iOS. It's
also available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

It's not perfect, but I'm proud of it. It's a fun little time-waster. It plays 
well and it sounds great. And I did it all by myself. *pats own back*
