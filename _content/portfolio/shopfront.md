summary: A platform for digital marketing in the retail sector
---
This was a big project.

It started small enough. A system to print shelf tickets for a group of pharmacies.
Of course, that had its own technical challenges. Not least of which was printing
from a browser in such a way that it would be consistent with pre-printed and/or
pre-perforated paper. We ended up developing an unobtrusive background application
for windows that would handle communication with the printer, and a separate web
system for creating the print jobs.

This expanded a lot. We built an entire visual editor for printible tickets with
multiple dynamic labels and layouts of those labels. We also expanded the management
side of the system to handle promotional periods and other forms of marketing. 
The idea became for marketing departments to create and upload assets and product
pricing details, and the stores just had to log on and print what was relevant to
them.

With nearly a thousand stores using the system, there was a lot of iteration around
the UI/UX of the system, especially about making life easier for the store users.
We also started handling support tickets and calls (myself included) in order to
better assist the stores. This helped me put an emphesis on the UX design, as I
got to know the kinds of people that were using the system (and designing things
so I had less support tickets to attend do :P ).

Before I left, I was part of the management of the product as a whole, and was 
working on a big redesign and re-branding. Partially in an attempt to simplify
the entire system, and to reach out to more non-pharmacy retail chains and outlets.
